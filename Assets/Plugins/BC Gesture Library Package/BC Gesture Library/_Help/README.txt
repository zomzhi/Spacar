BC GESTURE LIBRARY QUICK START GUIDE

To use the BC Gesture Library Samples, put all the product files in a folder. Go to your BCGestureLibraryFolder/assets/scenes, open any scene and hit play. To view the gestures in action with the sample scenes, in the Unity editor open any scene from your BCGestureLibraryFolder/Assets/Scenes and play.

To use the BC Gesture Library classes in your code:

1) Copy the BC Gesture Library folder from your BCGestureLibraryProjectFolder/Assets/Plugins/BC Gesture Library into your project's Plugins folder and the gesture classes are ready to use. Note: BC Gesture Library must be in a Plugins folder.

2) Drag a gesture class from the BC Gesture Library onto one of your Game Objects and set its parameters. You can also control the parameters from your code.
 
3) Copy events from GestureEvent example code in _Help into your code and then add your code in.

It's that simple!

If you want to see the gesture classes in action please feel free to look in the gesture sample code in your BCGestureLibraryProjectFolder/Assets/Scripts/Samples and copy code from the samples.
